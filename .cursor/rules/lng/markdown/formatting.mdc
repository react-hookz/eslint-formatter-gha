# Markdown Formatting Standards

## Context

- Ensures consistent formatting and structure in Markdown documents.
- Helps maintain readability and professional appearance.
- Applies to all Markdown document creation and editing.
- Enables better documentation and knowledge sharing.
- Creates consistent experience across different Markdown renderers.

## Critical rules

- Follow Markdown best practices for formatting.
- Maintain clear document structure with proper heading hierarchy.
- Use Mermaid UML diagrams for documenting complex sequences or architecture.
- Maximum heading depth: 4 levels (h1-h4).
- Indent content within XML tags by 2 spaces.
- Code blocks must indicate the language properly after the initial 3 backticks.
- Keep tables properly aligned with consistent spacing.
- Use blank lines between different content blocks for readability.
- Use proper list formatting: unordered lists with `-` and ordered lists with numbers.
- Use descriptive link text rather than raw URLs.
- Include alt text for images.
- Keep line length under 120 characters for better readability.
- Use fenced code blocks with language specifiers instead of indented code blocks.
- End all sentences with a period to maintain proper grammar and readability.
- Use proper heading capitalization (title case for h1-h2, sentence case for h3-h4).
- Add a space after list markers (- or numbers) for consistent rendering.
- Use consistent emphasis formatting (either \* or \_ for italics/bold, not mixed).
