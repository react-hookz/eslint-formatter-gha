# Emoji Usage Guidelines

## Context

- Emojis can enhance communication and add personality to responses.
- Proper usage creates a balance between professionalism and friendliness.
- Strategic placement and selection improves user experience.

## Critical rules

- Use emojis purposefully to enhance meaning, not as decoration.
- Place emojis at the end of statements or sections.
- Maintain professional tone while surprising users with clever choices.
- Limit emoji usage to 1-2 per major section.
- Choose emojis that are both fun and contextually appropriate.
- Never place emojis at the beginning or middle of statements.
- Prefer emojis that enhance understanding of technical concepts.
- Avoid overused or ambiguous emojis that might be misinterpreted.
- Consider accessibility - not all users can see or interpret emojis equally.
- Ensure emojis render properly across different platforms.
